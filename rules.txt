The Poker Hand Rankings (Most to Least Powerful)
This is the most important part. A player with a higher-ranking hand wins.

Royal Flush: (A-K-Q-J-10, all of the same suit)

Straight Flush: (Five cards in a row, all of the same suit, e.g., 7-8-9-10-J of Hearts)

Four of a Kind: (Four cards of the same rank, e.g., four Aces)

Full House: (Three of a kind + one pair, e.g., three Kings and two 5s)

Flush: (Any five cards of the same suit, not in a row, e.g., A-K-8-5-2 of Spades)

Straight: (Five cards in a row, but different suits, e.g., 6-7-8-9-10)

Three of a Kind: (Three cards of the same rank, e.g., three Jacks)

Two Pair: (Two different pairs, e.g., two Aces and two 7s)

One Pair: (Two cards of the same rank, e.g., two Queens)

High Card: (If no one has any of the above, the player with the single highest card wins, e.g., "Ace-high")
